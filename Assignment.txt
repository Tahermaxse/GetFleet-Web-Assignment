# **Frontend Assignment (Web + Mobile)**

## **Overview**

Please implement the login flow and fleet tracking dashboard shown in the Figma design for both web and mobile platforms using the real staging APIs provided below.

This assignment focuses on:
• Clean architecture & component reusability (more important than pixel-perfect functionality)
• Proper session handling with token-based validation
• Thoughtful, maintainable code structure
• Visual alignment with the design (Same As The Design)

---

## **Scope**

You will build:

• **Web version → Next.js 14 + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS**
• **Mobile version → Expo + React Native Paper + react-native-maps**

---

## **Figma Design Reference**

[https://www.figma.com/design/Q11b56RpfBHjf5Yor1MSSr/Assignmnt?node-id=0-1](https://www.figma.com/design/Q11b56RpfBHjf5Yor1MSSr/Assignmnt?node-id=0-1)

**Note:** The Login Page is UI only (No real login).
On clicking the Login CTA button, persist the token on frontend and validate the session using the session API for protected routes (**/dashboard**).

---

## **API Endpoints (Staging)**

### **1. Session Check**

GET
`https://gps-staging.getfleet.ai/api/session?token=token-value`

**Token:**

```
RzBFAiAq7IHa-vP8YEX8vtU_FUhYKjOi7vBMWjLN2yEAbKmYNQIhANtH3uMrlkLBSwScRikMYqgWa5mlrp2xQeDNmM9CWg4eyJ1Ijo0LCJlIjoiMjAyNi0wMS0wMVQwMDowMDowMC4wMDArMDA6MDAifQ
```

All protected endpoints require the token as a query parameter:
`?token=tokenvalue`

---

### **2. Devices**

GET
`https://gps-staging.getfleet.ai/api/devices`

### **3. Latest Positions**

GET
`https://gps-staging.getfleet.ai/api/positions`

---

## **CORS Proxy Setup (Web Only)**

Add this to **next.config.js**:

```
const nextConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        destination: 'https://gps-staging.getfleet.ai/api/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

---

## **Submission**

• Two repositories (web and mobile)
• **Web must be deployed on Vercel**
• **Mobile:** share Expo project or QR code
• Include a short README
• No official deadline — complete as early as possible

---

# **What’s Expected**

## **Web (Next.js 14 – App Router)**

• TypeScript + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
• Use rewrites in next.config.js to proxy APIs (CORS)
• Any map library (Leaflet, Mapbox, Google Maps, etc.)
• Deploy on Vercel (Required)

---

## **Mobile (Expo)**

• Expo + Expo Router
• React Native Paper + built-in StyleSheet
• Any map library
• No App Store publish needed — Expo QR code is enough

---

## **Core Requirements (Both Platforms)**

• Session validation
• Token must persist after app/page restart
• On login success → navigate to protected dashboard
• Fetch **/devices** and **/positions**
• Show every device as a marker on the map using its latest position
• Clean folder structure, reusable components, separation of concerns
• Focus on architecture, reusability, and code quality more than perfect functionality
• Small thoughtful UX improvements are appreciated

If you want, I can also prepare:

✅ A clean README for your repo
✅ Folder structure for Web + Mobile
✅ Starter code templates
✅ API utility wrapper
Just tell me!
